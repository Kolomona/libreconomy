# Market System Research & Brainstorming

## Session Start: December 1, 2025

### Topic: What would a market component need to be useful in this simulation?

---

**Initial Brainstorm:**

- Representation of goods/services (item types, quantities)
- Buyers and sellers (agent/entity references)
- Price information (current price, price history, bid/ask)
- Trade offers (buy/sell orders, bartering proposals)
- Transaction records (completed trades, timestamps)
- Market rules (allowed goods, trading constraints)
- Supply and demand tracking (aggregate quantities, trends)
- Market events (price changes, new offers, completed trades)
- Mechanism for price discovery (auction, negotiation, posted prices)
- Support for multiple market types (barter, currency-based)
- Extensibility for custom market logic

---

**Next:**
- Expand on each item with pros/cons and possible data structures
- Discuss how agents interact with the market
- Consider edge cases and extensibility
