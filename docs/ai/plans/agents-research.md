# Agents System Research & Brainstorming

## Session Start: December 1, 2025

### Topic: What does an agent need to be useful in this simulation?

---

**Initial Brainstorm:**

- Unique identifier (AgentId)
- Needs (thirst, hunger, etc.)
- Inventory (items owned)
- Wallet (currency)
- Skills (production capabilities)
- Knowledge (known prices, trade partners)
- Employment status (job, employer, employees)
- Preferences (utility function, risk tolerance)
- Decision-making logic (trait-based, pluggable)
- Lifecycle management (creation, removal)
- Extensibility for custom components

---

**Next:**
- Expand on each item with pros/cons and possible data structures
- Discuss agent interactions with other systems
- Consider edge cases and extensibility
